# Time-Series-Weather-Forecasting

Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast future weather conditions using historical climate data. The dataset contains multiple weather parameters recorded over time, allowing us to model and predict future trends.

Data
The dataset used in this project is jena_climate_2009_2016.csv, which contains weather data from 2009 to 2016, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.

Features
Time Series Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and resampling.
Feature Engineering: Creating lag variables, normalizing data, and adding trend/seasonality components.
Deep Learning Model: LSTM implementation for future weather forecasting.
Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Time series plots, prediction vs. actual trend analysis.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-weather-forecasting.git
cd time-series-weather-forecasting
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Run the notebook:
Open Lstm_Model_Future_Forecasting_WeatherDataset.ipynb and execute all the cells. The model will train on the weather data and generate future predictions.
